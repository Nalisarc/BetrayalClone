* TODO Readme 
Traitor, is a personal project to transform the board game Betrayal on the House on the Hill by Bruce Glasses
into a computer program. I started writing this for the #100daysofcode challenge. While the main program is written
in python. Due to the nature of the style of document that this is written in. You could potentially convert the code into 
any language with a bit of work.
You can build your own copy of the game by opening index.org in emacs, and running entering C-c C-v C-t.

** Statistics
Each stat contains a tuple of 9 possible vaules. The 0 slot of each stat is always "dead".
The remaining stats represent the number of dice that are roled for that type of roll.
The speed stat is also used to tell how many spaces a character can move per turn.
There might be some confusion about what the starting and current values mean.
These reference the range tuple slot, not the actual value itself. 
#+name: Stat_Object
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  class Stat(object):

      def __init__(self, range_, current):
          self.range_ = ('dead') + range_
          self.current = current
          return None

    

#+END_SRC

** Changing Stats
Sometimes in the game your characters will take damage.
Characters have four stats, these are broken up into two different catagories:
1. Mental
   * Knowledge
   * Sanity
2. Physical
   * Might
   * Speed

If a character takes damage to a category they have the ability to chose which stat takes the damage, 
and in cases of multiple points they can divide the points up however they chose so long all the points of damage are taken.
However if damage is dealt directly to a stat the character must take damage to that stat  unless it is mitigated somehow.

When a stat is damaged the current slot for that stat is reduced by points of damage taken.
\( current = current - damage \)
If this would push the slot into the negatives, or to 0 the character is dead. 

Raising a value is pretty much the same as taking damage, but in reverse.
The highest value is 8 and additional points are negated. 
\( current = current + raise \)

#+name: Character_Change_Stat
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  def change_stat(self, stat, value):
      """To raise the stat use a positive integer, 
      to lower the stat use a negative integer"""
      self.stat['current'] += value
      #Performs 0 check
      if self.stat['current'] < 0:
          self.stat['current'] = 0
      #Performs 8 check    
      if self.stat['current'] > 8:
          self.stat['current'] = 8
      #Change sucessful
      return None
#+END_SRC

Should a character take lethal damage before the haunt has started, the damage is negated and the stat is set to 1
This will be handled by the engine not the character object.

** Getting the stat value
** Miscellaneous Information 
Characters have some bits of miscellaneous information in addition to their core statistics.
This includes the name of the character, their age, birthday, hobbies, and other bits.
While it may seem a bit odd this information is used to determine player order, and in haunts.

** Moving
** MoveError
The MoveError is a custom exception used when the characters are unable to move for some reason.

** Tests
#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle tests/character_tests.py

* TODO House
The house is a 3 dimensional space, with various points representing the rooms.
 These points are always intigers, that can range from negative to positive.
 Each point is represented by a 3 digit vector (x,y,z).
 In normal operations Z should only ever range from -1 to 1. However I will not restrict this implicetly.
 Movement across the map is in what is called Taxi-Cab geometry. You cannot move diagonally under normal operations.

 Players can move any of the following directions:
 Cardinal Directions:
  * North
  * South
  * East
  * West

 Special Directions:
  * Up
  * Down
  * In
  * Out

 East and West increase and decrease the x axis by 1
 North and South increase and decrease the y axis by 1.

 In and Out are special, and can be thought of teleporting the player or monster to whatever it is connected to.
 In and Out only appear in a few cases, such as secret doors.
 Up and Down could in theory increase and decrease the z axis. And in somecases it might. However the upperlanding and basement landing
 are located at (0,0,1) and (0,0,-1) respectively. And rooms like the collapsed room, and the coal shute could be located anywhere on 
 the map. However if the basement had not been explored yet, it could lead to situations where the players become trapped and never able to
 return upstairs. To prevent this, up and down will also be treated like in and out. 

 If at any point a floor becomes blocked off, the house is suppose to adjust itself, so that at least one door is free.
 If there are no more rooms to discover but there are still open doors, those doors become disabled.

** Room Table
This table contains a list of all the rooms in Tratior along with their initial properties.
It is dynamically generated from rooms.org.
The columns are gathered from the property block on each room.
The name of the room is gathered from the headline.
Additional notes can be added in beneigh the property drawer, however they will be represented in the table.
If you want to add in new rooms:
 1. Go to rooms.org
 2. Add a new headline.
 3. Fill in the property drawer
 4. Save
 5. Run C-c C-c on the Begin block below

** Room Object
   The room object is the representation of a room tile, the room object should be able to be easily represented by a table.
A room contains a few bits of information:
 1. The Room's Name:
  This is a string of arbitrary length and characters.
 2. The Room's Shape:
  Rooms in traitor are square tiles with a number of doors in them. The shape is represented with a tuple indicating whether or not
  that particular door is enabled.
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (True,True,True,True)
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  If no shape is given, the room assumes that all doors have been enabled. And therefore are valid directions.
 3. The Room's Floor:
  Not all rooms are allowed on all floors. If no value is given, the room assumes that it is allowed on any floor.
 4. What Happens There:
  In traitor, there are a number of items, events, and omens, that are found through out the house.
  Some rooms are harder to move through, and some rooms will either hurt you, or heal you.

Barrier rooms are a subtype of room, you can enter from one side but inorder to cross it you mut pass some sort of challenge.
For the most part these are simply a roll, however if you fail the challenge you stop moving for the turn.

However negative effects tend to happen anytime you end your turn in that room; whereas positive tend to only

These rooms all have something special about them by default that is difficult to catagories, or would lead to unnessisarly

** Moving Between Rooms
 Room objects have a move method, this takes a direction from their edges table and returns the coordnates.
 The idea is so that each character, monster, ect has a "position" that is the room's coordnates.
 In the event that the room hasn't been discovered, it sends up an assertion error that signals to the engine to discover a room.

** Discovering Rooms
Should a player move into a room that hasn't been discovered yet, that player uncovers a new room.
This selection is done at random from the room list, certain rooms can only be placed on certain floors.
If the newly discoved room has an event in it, the player must stop moving and activate the event!

* Dice
The dice in tratior are a type of six sided dice that have the values: 0,1,2 printed twice.
To represent this in the game, dice are a d3 with those values.
The player will role a number of dice equal to the stat on that roll.
For example: if you were to role a knowledge roll and your stat was 3, you would get back the sum of
3 random numbers between 0-2. Therefore the highest you can get is 6.
In the game, there are only 8 dice. I won't be capping that number explictly because you won't get above it in game.
The maximum possible output is 2N and the minimum possible output is always 0
