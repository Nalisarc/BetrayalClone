** Statistics
Stats are represented as dictionaries containing the following bits of info:
 * Value list
 * Starting Slot
 * Current Slot

Each stat contains a list of 9 possible vaules. The 0 slot of each stat is always "dead".
The remaining stats represent the number of dice that are roled for that type of roll.
The speed stat is also used to tell how many spaces a character can move per turn.
If a character hits 0 oead, they are dead. However if the character would take fatal damage before the haunt has started
the Character will stay at the lowest value possible that does not kill them.
If a character would go above the highest value, they will simply stay at that value.

** Damage and Raising
Sometimes in the game your characters will take damage.
Characters have four stats, these are broken up into two different catagories:
1. Mental
   * Knowledge
   * Sanity
2. Physical
   * Might
   * Speed

If a character takes damage to a category they have the ability to chose which stat takes the damage, 
and in cases of multiple points they can divide the points up however they chose so long all the points of damage are taken.
However if damage is dealt directly to a stat the character must take damage to that stat  unless it is mitigated somehow.

When a stat is damaged the current slot for that stat is reduced by points of damage taken.
\( CurrentSlot = OldCurrentSlot - Damage \)

If this would push the slot into the negatives, or to 0 the character is dead. 
However if the haunt has not started yet characters cannot take lethal damage.
In this case, the stat is set to the lowest non dead value.



** Miscellaneous Information 
Characters have some bits of miscellaneous information in addition to their core statistics.
This includes the name of the character, their age, birthday, hobbies, and other bits.
While it may seem a bit odd this information is used to determine player order, and in haunts.
